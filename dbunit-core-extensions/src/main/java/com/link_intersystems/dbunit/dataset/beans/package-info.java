/**
 * The beans package provides support for mapping java beans as {@link org.dbunit.dataset.IDataSet}s.
 *
 *<p>
 *     Bean based data sets are easier to maintain then xml, xls or csv based data sets in case of schema changes,
 *     because you can apply your IDE's refactoring tools. You can also add property getters that apply some kind
 *     of domain logic or calculate default values.
